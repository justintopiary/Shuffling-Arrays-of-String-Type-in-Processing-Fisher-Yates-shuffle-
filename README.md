Shuffling Array of String Type in Processing (Fisher Yates shuffle)

This is a Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle used for shuffling string arrays; the algorithm used here is as described: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Modern_method  
The great part about this shuffle, is that it doesn't require another array to be substituted into. 
The code simply swaps pairs of numbers in the array in such a way that results in a randomised array. 
The code creates an unbiased permutation, and thus every permutation should be equally as likely. 
I hope this helped! This was coded in Processing 3.5.3
